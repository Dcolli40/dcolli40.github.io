        <h4>File Management</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The files in this site are organized very well and aesthetically pleasing. It is also very simple to find all the information that he has posted in his site.</li>
                <li>The use of the drop down sub menu takes the site up many notches as it is something that I haven't seen incorporated in to many sites yet.</li>
                <li>This makes his site look less cluttered and much more clean and organized.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Styles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The colors that were chosed for the main site is very easy on the eyes.</li>
                <li>The subtle use of green to tie in with the mascot is a nice touch.</li>
                <li>The site is consistent throughout with the color scheme.</li>
                <li>The margins on the side accomodate for many screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Font Choice is easy to read and looks clean.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Page Design</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Again the margins keep the page looking professional and their consistency is very nice to see on all pages.</li>
                <li>The site uses proper fonts and good colors to make the viewing experience enjoyable.</li>
                <li>There isn't any annoying details that are painful to look at.</li>
                <li>I like the aspect of pages built being not included in the background of the footer while also being a different color to stand out.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Validation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Validation buttons are formatted properly.</li>
                <li>Hovering over the buttons the link ends with referer.</li>
                <li>All pages fully validate with no errors.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Page Code</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The page code works perfectly on all pages that have JS in them.</li>
                <li>The HTML include is not being utilized, which could make the time spent copying and pasting not be wasted.</li>
                <li>But other than that, this is a wonderful webpage and it definently does not look like a first website.</li>
            </ul>
