                  <p>A jam serve is an important tool for any competitive spikeball player to have. The jam serve is used to make the reviever of the serve awkward and make a bad touch to their partner. Using this servee along with cut and reverse and mixing them together rounds out a deadly serving kit.</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Start by lining up with your right left infront of your right(if you are right handed), facing your left shoulder directly to the net</li>
                     <li>Take your left foot and set backwards, opening up your hips towards the net.</li>
                     <li>
                        Hit the ball with your plams open in order to not put much cut spin on the ball.
                        <ul>
                           <li>When performing a jam serve you know that it is hitting properly when your serve hits the body of the reciever. Remember that you want them to try and touch the ball! Just make it as difficult as possible!</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
