            <p>Body Defense is when one member of your team positions themselves at the net to try and block an opposing teams spike up into the air. Body Defense utilizes the new <a href = "howtoplay.html" title="Learn about the rules here" >Soft Touch Rule</a> which means that if a defender hits a ball that is going in the upwards trajectory, they may hit the ball again. Hitting the ball again is the second hit for the team so the other team member must put the ball on net after a soft touch is used.</p>

               <p class = "bodyexp">This diagram displays what the positioning for body defense should look like. One member of the team should be close to net on one need to try and block the hit on net to the other team member. When positioning for a body the player bodying should move to cut off the path of the ball to block it for the other member of the team who should be directly accross the net. Generally the player that is not serving is the one that should go to net for the body, and the player that is serving should be looking to read the ball off of their teammates body. Trust is needed in eachother to get the body up. Sometimes players willl make great hits, but dont be discouraged! Get the next one! </p>
