        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>I started doing computer science in high school and I have a brief background in robotics and have been working as a tutor for a few years now.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong>For most of my short professional life I have worked as a tutor for middle school students who are looking to learn how to code.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>I am a computer science major with a concentration in software engineering. I was in the Academy of information Technology in high school where I took specialized computer science related courses.</li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong>I have taken Software Engineering so I have some ideas about HTML and CSS.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary computer platform:</strong>Windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ITCS 3160:</strong>I am taking database design and implementation to learn about how to efficiently and optimally use, create and edit databases.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 3135:</strong>I am taking web based application and design to put together all the things that I've learned about databases and grow my knowledge of HTML and CSS.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 3310:</strong> I'm taking software architecture and design to understand the importance of the foundation of a coding project and how to establish a proper foundation in my own projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 3688:</strong>I am taking computers and their impact on society to prepare myself for the work place environment and learn how to present in an entertaining, informative and professional manner.</li>
                    <li><strong>LBST 2301:</strong> I am taking this course to be able to basically check of a box to get a degree but I hope to learn something impactful from it.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Interesting Thing:</strong>I was able to go to Mexico over winter break with my college group at my church. We drove 24 hours straight there and then we built a house in 3 days and drove 24 hours back. Definitely one of the best experiences of my life.</li>
            <li><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong>Jesus loves you, and if you don't know why, send me an email I'd love to share the good news with you!</li>
