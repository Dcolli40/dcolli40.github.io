                  <p>Here we will cover a summation of the rules that everyone should know before playing. Attached below is the official Spikeball Roundnet Association Rules for you to read yourself!</p>
                  <ol class = "rule">
                     <li>
                        Getting Started
                        <ul>
                           <li>Spikeball is played with 2 teams of 2 players.</li>
                           <li>Each team starts every point adjacent to their partners and directly across from the other team.</li>
                           <li>A point is scored whenever the ball is hit cleanly onto the net and then hits the ground. Whichever team is responsible for the hit that resulted in the ball touching the ground gets the point.</li>
                           <li>Each team has 3 hits between eachother to return the ball to the net.</li>
                           <li>Once a team hits the ball on the net, the other team has three hits to put the ball back on the net.</li>
                           <li>If a ball that is hit on the net touches the rim of the net the defending team wins the point.</li>
                           <li>Servers get one fault before giving the point to the other team. 2 bad serves results in the other team getting the point and the serve.</li>
                           <li>Whoever wins the point gets to serve.</li>
                           <li>Like volleyball, you cannot hit the ball multiple times in a row.</li>
                           <li>Every 5 points every player rotates one position to the right.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Serving
                        <ul>
                           <li>Server gets 2 serves if the first one is bad they get to serve again.</li>
                           <li>The Server must serve from at least 7ft. away from the net.</li>
                           <li>If the serve misses the net, hits the rim, or goes above the recievers shoulder it is a fault.</li>
                           <li>The server cannot fall after the ball has been hit, they must keep their balance and remain outside the 7ft. circle. If the server fails to maintain balance after the ball has been hit, it is a fault no matter what the ball does.</li>
                           <li>A server must call score before serving or else it is counted as a score fault.</li>
                           <li>A server has 5 seconds to serve the ball after calling score.</li>
                           <li>When serving the server can take one step and have one established pivot foot.</li>
                           <li>If the serving team wins the point the server switches places with their teammate and continues serving</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        No Hit Zone
                        <ul>
                           <li>The No Hit Zone is a 1 foot area around the net that players cannot hit the ball onto the net while being inside the zone.</li>
                           <li>Players can jump over the zone after they have hit, but cannot have their foot in while hitting the ball and cannot land in the zone after hitting.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Soft Touch
                        <ul>
                           <li>If a player touches a ball that is on the way up in trajectory from the net that player may touch the ball again.</li>
                           <li>The second touch the player hits counts as the second touch for the team, so that player's teammate must hit the ball onto the net.</li>
                           <li>You cannot take the soft touch and hit it back on to the net.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Hinder
                        <ul>
                           <li>If an opposing player is in the way of a defensive touch hinder is called and the point is replayed back to first serve.</li>
                           <li>If a player has a "Strong Play" to the net that is interrupted by a hinder the point is given to the hindered team.</li>
                           <li>Most hinders except for hinders that take place when someone is hitting the ball onto the net result in a replay of the point.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                  </ol>
