                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>R: </strong> Repeptition

                        <li>Aligning your webpage is important to make it look organized.</li>
                        <li>Proper alignment has unified margins and spacing thoughout.</li>
                    </ul></li>

                    <ul>

        <h3><a href = "http://sushiiwa.org/">Sushi Iwa's Website</a></h3>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/crapsite.png" alt = "Site One">
            <figcaption>Sushiiwa.org</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong>The contrast of this site is very poor, everything looks very dark and it does not invoke a welcoming feeling in patrons</li>
            <li><strong>Repeptition:</strong>This site has some inconsistencys but there is not any clear repetition there.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong>The alignment seems off and looks like it was thrown together very quickly without much thought.
                <ul>
                    <li>As you can see I have drawn on the image so it is easier to see what I'm talking about.</li>
                    <li>The alignment is poor because of where the nav bar is located being awkward on the page.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong>The proximity of elements on the page is poorly done because of how the pictures are overlapping and making it hard to see what the site is trying to show us. 
                <ul>
                    <li>There are hidden shushi Iwa logos in the picture elements which looks as if it shouldn't be there.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3><a href = "https://www.nike.com/w/mens-shoes-nik1zy7ok">Nike's Website</a></h3>
        <figure>
            <img src = "images/goodcrapsite.png" alt = "Site two" >
            <figcaption>Nike.com</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong>The contrast of Nike's site is very simple with just using white for the background and black for the text.
                <ul>
                    <li>The simplicity of this makes the shoes that Nike is selling stand out more because they are the only colorful thing on the page.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Repeptition:</strong>Everything is repeated nicely and there is a clear uniform pattern that the website has. which helps make it aesthetically pleasing to view.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong>The alignment and margins are done vey well. Everything has its own place on the site and nothing interrupts the flow of it.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong>Everything is spaced out enough and the text does not take away from the point of the site which is selling shoes.</li>
        </ul>
